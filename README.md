## Instructions
In order to run the example you need the csv file with the information related the penguins (available in repository) and run below command to create the trained model.

`python penguins-model-building.py`

After running this command you will get the penguins_clf.pkl file and you will be able to run the app by runnint below command.

`streamlit run penguins-app.py`

Once done above steps you will see on the terminal below output.
